# Mappedin Viewer WordPress Plugin

The Mappedin Viewer Plugin for WordPress allows users to easily add interactive indoor maps to WordPress pages using a simple shortcode. Refer to the [Mappedin Viewer Plugin for WordPress Guide](https://developer.mappedin.com/pre-built-applications/mappedin_web_plugin_for_wordpress) for more information.

Note: A Mappedin account is required. This plugin will not add maps to your WordPress pages without one. Visit [www.mappedin.com](www.mappedin.com) for more information.

This plugin requires access to Mappedin's cloud services to download map data. The Mappedin Viewer renderer is not included in this plugin because its versioning is independently controlled by Mappedin cloud infrastructure.
