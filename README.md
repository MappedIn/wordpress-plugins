# Mappedin Template Repo

This is a simple project to use as a template when creating new repos. If you are in a new repo looking at this text, consider adding any standard boilerplate work you put in your repo back to the template.

Make sure you adjust these coverge URLs to replace `template` with your repo name. They will exist after the first time you push to master.

This template currently has:

- [x] Standard Pull Request Template

- [x] gitignore

- [x] Standard package.json with test commands

- [x] Config for eslint, editorconfig, and prettier

- [x] Jest and Typescript set up

- [x] Standard CI jobs

- [x] Commit conventions and commit lint

- [x] release-please github workflow

- [ ] Template readme

You will probably still need to set up branch protection and permissions.

# TODO Before First PR
- [ ] Change CODEOWNERS to point at your team
